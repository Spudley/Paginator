This is a test
file with a number
of lines of text
that will be used as
part of the test
for the paginator
class. This file will be
loaded using the SPLFileObject class
and will be passed into
the paginator. This allows
us to test an iterator type that is less
flexible in that it
does not allow reading backwards.
Each line in this file will
represent an element in
the iterator. The paginator
should be able to extract
data for a given page number
and given page length
and produce the appropriate
part of this file.
The lines in
this file are written
in a broken form
so that we can
split this text over
more lines.
